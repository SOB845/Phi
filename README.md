## FAQs
### Not a fan of Computer Vision? 
Phi.ai is a sister project to Pi.ai, an open-source Natural Language Processing platform designed and developed with the same idea. If you are a NLP researcher or you just want to keep updated on the newest trends and breakthroughs, see Pi.ai at [here](https://github.com/SOB845/Pi).

### How does it work?
Phi.ai and Pi.ai were origionally built with the goal of creating a friendly and peaceful place for young researchers to share and review their papers with others such that they don't have to own an academic email address.
The process itself is pretty straight-forward. For getting started, you just need to create a researcher account with your real names.
